# PROJECT GOALS

## Overview
This project implements an autonomous multi-agent system where Claude Code instances collaborate 24/7 to improve code quality, implement features, and maintain the codebase.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Continuous Code Quality Improvement
- Automatically identify and fix code smells
- Improve performance bottlenecks
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Maintain consistent code style

### 2. Security Enhancement
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Input validation improvements
- Authentication and authorization reviews

### 3. Test Coverage Expansion
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage
- Add integration tests for all endpoints
- Implement property-based testing where applicable
- Maintain test documentation

### 4. Documentation Maintenance
- Keep API documentation up-to-date
- Generate code documentation from docstrings
- Maintain architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Update README and setup guides

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Profile and optimize hot paths
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve startup time
- Optimize database queries

## Current Sprint Goals

### Week 1: Foundation
- [x] Set up MCP coordinator infrastructure
- [ ] Implement basic agent communication
- [ ] Create initial audit rules
- [ ] Test autonomous operation

### Week 2: Enhancement
- [ ] Add complex audit patterns
- [ ] Implement PR workflow automation
- [ ] Create agent performance metrics
- [ ] Add failure recovery mechanisms

### Week 3: Scaling
- [ ] Support multiple concurrent coders
- [ ] Implement task prioritization
- [ ] Add resource management
- [ ] Create agent orchestration rules

## Success Metrics
- **Code Quality Score**: Maintain A+ rating
- **Test Coverage**: >90% across all modules
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Zero high/critical issues
- **Performance**: <100ms response time for 95% of requests
- **Uptime**: 99.9% agent availability

## Agent Collaboration Rules

1. **Auditor First**: All changes must originate from audit findings
2. **Plan Before Code**: No implementation without approved plan
3. **Test Everything**: All code changes require tests
4. **Review Required**: All PRs need review before merge
5. **Document Changes**: Update docs with every feature

## Continuous Improvement Areas
- Machine learning model optimization
- API response time reduction
- Database query efficiency
- Frontend performance
- Build time optimization
- Test execution speed

## Notes for Agents
- Prioritize security fixes over features
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow semantic versioning
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Update this file with completed goals
